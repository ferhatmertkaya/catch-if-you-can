# Catch If You Can

A first-person paranormal-investigation horror game. Unity 6000.5.10f1, URP
17.5.0, Forward+, IL2CPP. Mobile is the primary target (iOS and Android);
desktop is a development convenience, not the platform being designed for.

## Read these before changing anything

| Document | When it applies |
|---|---|
| `Docs/AGENT_OWNERSHIP.md` | Always, if anyone else is working in this repo at the same time. Who owns what, and the files no two agents may touch at once. |
| `Docs/DETERMINISM.md` | **Normative.** Any change under `Scripts/Procedural/**` or to the deterministic set. A violation is a bug even if it looks right in the editor. |
| `Docs/DEVELOPMENT_LABS.md` | Working on, or in, one of the nine `DEV_` lab scenes. |
| `Docs/UNITY_VALIDATION.md` | Claiming that something works. |
| `Docs/NETWORKING.md` | Anything multiplayer. No netcode package is installed yet. |

## The rules that are enforced, not trusted

- `Scripts/check_determinism.sh` — the deterministic set stays pure and the
  layout hash stays stable. 44 checks, all must pass.
- `Scripts/check_dev_scenes.sh` — no `DEV_` scene is ever enabled in the build
  list.

Both run in CI (`.github/workflows/determinism.yml`). Run them locally before
pushing; they need nothing but a shell.

## The mistakes this project has already made

Repeating one of these is the most likely way to break something.

1. **A second implementation instead of a fix.** There were two flashlights
   and two inventories. Both merged cleanly and only one of each was real. If
   the existing one is wrong, change it.
2. **A built-in shader fallback.** `Shader.Find("Standard")` resolves
   everywhere and draws solid magenta under URP. Ask `Art.CiycShaders` and
   accept null — a missing object is better than a magenta one.
3. **A `Resources.Load` path that has never existed.** The ghost prefab path
   had the project name in it twice, missed silently for the life of the
   project, and made every ghost the primitive fallback. Reach content through
   `Content.CiycContentRegistry` by reference.
4. **Reflection into another class's private fields.** It compiles, reviews
   clean, and fails silently on the next rename. Ask for a public method.
5. **Reading a low compiler error count as success.** The offline typecheck
   harness stops early when its own stub breaks and then reports *zero*
   project errors. Always diff against the recorded baseline; never read a
   drop as good news without finding out which errors went and why.

## Unity Editor availability

Most work on this project happens where Unity cannot run. When it cannot:

- Author assets through **editor tools** (`Editor/*Builder.cs`), not by
  hand-writing prefab or scene YAML. A prefab is a graph of cross-referencing
  documents; hand-writing one is how references get silently broken.
  ScriptableObject `.asset` files are the exception — a single document with
  one script reference is safe to write and can be verified by parsing it.
- Preserve `.meta` GUIDs. Never regenerate one to fix an import.
- Mark every runtime claim **NOT TESTED**. Do not say a thing works because
  it compiles.
